# README â€“ Python Programming Assignment (PA1)

# What this Project is About
This notebook is my first programming assignment in Python.  
It contains simple problems that helped me practice basic coding skills.  

# The problems include things like:  
- Taking input from the user  
- Printing outputs  
- Working with strings and lists  
- Using functions and loops  

Some of the problems I solved here are:  
- ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM:  

- EMOTICON PROBLEM:  

- UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM

# What you will see
When you run the code, the answers or results will show up right under the code cell.  
Some cells will print results like converted emoticons, rearranged strings, or processed lists.  

# Why this Matters
The goal of this project is to learn the basics of Python programming in a hands-on way.  
It shows that I can write, run, and explain simple Python programs step by step.
