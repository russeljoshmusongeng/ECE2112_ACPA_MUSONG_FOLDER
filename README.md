# README â€“ Python Programming Assignment (PA1)

# What this Project is About
This notebook is my first programming assignment in Python.  
It contains simple problems that helped me practice basic coding skills.  

# The problems include things like:  
- Taking input from the user  
- Printing outputs  
- Working with strings and lists  
- Using functions and loops  

The problems I solved here are:  
- ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM:  
Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters
in alphabetical order.

- EMOTICON PROBLEM:  
Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence
as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad and mad with their corresponding emoticon:

- UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM:
Unpack the list write your code here into three variables, being first,
middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element. Then print all three
variables.

# What you will see
When you run the code, the user must input the satified condition for the code to run, afterwards, 
the outputs will show up right under the code cell. Some cells will print results like converted emoticons, 
rearranged strings, or processed lists.  

# Why this Matters
The goal of this project is to learn the basics of Python programming in a hands-on way.  
It shows that I can write, run, and explain simple Python programs step by step. 

For further explanation about the codes refer to the main file.
